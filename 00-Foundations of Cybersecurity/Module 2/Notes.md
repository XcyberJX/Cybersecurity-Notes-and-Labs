# Notes
- In 1986, the Alvi brothers created the Brain virus. It was used to track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licenses.
- In 1988 Robert Morris developed a program to assess the size of the internet. 6,000 computers were affected, representing 10% of the internet at the time.
- In the year 2000, Onel De Guzmen created the LoveLetter malware to steal internet login credentials.
- The LoveLetter ended up infecting 45 million computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages.
- One way to safeguard your organization is to conduct regular internal trainings.
- In 2017, attackers successfully infiltrated the credit reporting agency, Equifax. One of the largest known data breaches of sensitive information. Over 143 million customer records were stolen, and the breach affected approximately 40% of all americans.
- The records included PII including social security numbers, birth dates, drivers license numbers, home addresses, and credit card numbers.

### Common attacks and their effectiveness:
- **Phishing** - The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying melicious software.

### Common phishing attacks used today:
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** - threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information in order to obtain financial advantages.
- **Spear Phishing** - a malicious email attack that targets a specific used or group of users. Email is usually originated from a trusted source.
- **Whaling** - Threat actors targets company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing** - The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
- **Smishing** - The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
- **Malware** - A software designed to harm devices or networks.
### Common malware attacks today:
- **Viruses** - Malicious code writted to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
- **Worms** - Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its on. It self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- **Ransomware** - A malicious attack where threats actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
- **Spyware** - Malware that is used to gather and sell information without consent. Used to access devices.
- **Social Engineering** - A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

### Common social engineerijng attacks today:
- **Social Media Phishing** - A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites.
- **Water Hole Attack** - A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB Baiting** - a threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.
- **Physical Social Enngineering** - A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorizedd access to physical location.

### Social Engineering Principles
#### Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:
- Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power.
- Intimidation: Threat actors use bully tactics.
- Consensus/Social proof: People sometimes do thiongs that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others trust to pretend they are legitimate.
- Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods and services are limited supply.
- Familiarity: Threat actors established a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.
- Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time.
- Urgency: A threat actor persuades to others to respond quickly and without question.

### The 8 CISSP security domains
- Security and Risk Management
- Asset Security
- Security Architecture and Engineering
- Communications and Network Security
- Identity and Access Management
- Security Assessment and Testing
- Security Operations
- Software Development Security

### 1. Security and Risk Management
- Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.
- Security may need to update commpany policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation as the Health Insurance Portability and Accoutability Act (HIPAA).

### 2. Asset Security
- Secures digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
- Security analyst may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed.

### 3. Security Architecture and Engineering
- Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.
- May be tasked with configuring a firewall. A firewall is a device used to  monitor and filter incoming and out going computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps prevent attacks that could affect productivity.

### 4. Communication and Network Security
- Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.
- You may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization.

### 5. Identity and Access Management
- Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, such as networks and applications.
- You may tasked with setting up employees keycard access to buildings.

### 6. Security Assessment Testing
- Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- May conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that the users have the correct level of access.

### 7. Security Operations
- Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

### 8. Software Development Security
- User secure coding practice, which are a set of reccommneded guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
- You may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed.

# Notes
- Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.
- Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

### Types of Social Engineering Attacks
- Supply-Chain attack: targets systems, applications. hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. This falls under, security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations.
- Cryptographic attack: Affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Forms of cryptographic attacks; Birthday, Collision, Downgrade. This falls under the communication and network security domain.

# Understanding Attackers
### Threat actors types:
- Advanced persistent threats (APTs): significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization.Their intentions and motivations can include: damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid aand natural resources. Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents.
- Insider threats: the abuse of authorized access to obtain data that may harm and organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: Sabotage, Corruption, Espionage, Unauthorized data access and leaks.
- Hacktivists: threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: Demonstrations, Propaganda, Social change campaigns, Fame.
- Hacker: any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. Three main categories of hackers: authorized, unauthorized and semi-authorized hackers.
