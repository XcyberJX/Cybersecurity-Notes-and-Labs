# Cybersecurity tools and programming languages
## Glossary Terms
- **Antivirus Software** - A software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses.
- **Database** - An organized collection of information or data.
- **Data Point** - A specific piece of information.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** - An application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusion.
- **Linux** - An open-source operating system.
- **Log** - A record of events that occur within an organization's systems.
- **Network Protocol Analyzer (packet sniffer)** - A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic withinj a network.
- **Order of Volatility** - A sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last.
- **Programming** - A process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
- **Protecting and Preserving Evidence** - The process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** - An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** - A query language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.

# Notes
- Logs include records of employees signing into their computers or accessing web-based services.
- Logs help security professionals identify vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.
- SIEM tools collect real-time, or instant, information and allow security analysts to identify potential breaches as they happen.
- SIEM tools reduce the amount of data am analyst must review.
- Commonly used SIEM tools: Splunk and Chronicle.
- Splunk is a data analyst platform.
- Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.
- Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis.
- As a security analyst, you may find yourself using SIEM tools to analyze filtered events and patterns, perform incident analysis, or proactively search for threats.
- Playbooks can pertain to security or compliance reviews, access management, and many other organizational tastes that require a documented process from beginning to end.
- Common network protocol analyzers include tcpdump and Wireshark.
- As an security analyst, involved in a forensic analysis, you will work with the computer data that was breached.
- The evidence is your responsibility while it is in your possession. Evidence must be kept safe and tracked. Everytime evidence is moved it should be reported.
- There are two types of playbooks; Chain of custody and Protecting and preserving evidence.
- Programming allows analyst to complete repetitive tasks and processes with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency.
- Linux is an open-source operating system.
- Linux traditional typically relies on the Command line inteface, (CLI) as the primary user interface, but modern distributions typically come with a graphical user interface (GUI), which allows users to interact with the system using windows, icons, and menus, similar to Windows or MacOS.
- A common use of Linux for entry-level security analysts is examining logs to better understand what's occurring in a system.
- An entry-level security analyst would use SQL to filter through the data points to retrieve specific information.
- Becoming familiar with standard tools to show employers that you have the ability to learn how to use their tools to protect the organization and the people it serves.

## More Terms
- **Web Vulnerability** - A unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.
- **Anitvirus Software** - A program used to prevent, detect, and  eliminate malware and viruses. Often called anti-malware. Can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware.
- **Encryption** - the process of converting data from a readable format to cryptographically encoded format.
- **Cryptographic Encoding** - Converting plaintext into secure ciphertext.
- **Plaintext** - unencrypted information.
- **Secure Ciphertext** - the result of encryption.
- **Penetration Testing** - the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulernabilities om systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. (Also called pen-testing.)
